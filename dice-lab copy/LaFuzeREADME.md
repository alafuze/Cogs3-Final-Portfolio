Wedding Planner Testing:
    * html file titled wedding.html
    Created a button that would introduce prompts for the numbers of guests and tables.


Dice Lab Images:
    I used the setInterval function to create a delay of 1000 milliseconds between each for loop --> I could not get the function to stop after the selected number of rolls but the balance keeps the correct outcome additions and the function has a 1000 millisecond delay between each roll.

    I commented out the code since there was a bug I couldn't fix, but I worked really hard on it so I am choosing to include it here anyway.

Optimal Wedding Planner;
    I created an if/else statement to create a condition where the number of guests is not evenly divided by the number of tables and then divided the modulo of the table and people numbers into their own table.
